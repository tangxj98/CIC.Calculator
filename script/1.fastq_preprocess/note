.sh index.extract.pe.sh <R1 fastq.gz>

2.  (Optional) if one sample was processed in multiple flowcell, run merge


3. format the output file with preprocess.pe.R
notice that spikein.control.txt is needed 
Rscript preprocessing.PE.R  BC1_R1_001.output.txt BC1 spikein.control.txt sample_index2.mapping.txt

output is *.mergeinput.txt
